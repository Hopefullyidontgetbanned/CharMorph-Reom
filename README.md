# Reom for Charmorph

Reom is a Character developed by ComplexAce and ported by Upliner to Charmorph.

It is designed to  follow muscle landmarks through its topology, and thus requires subdivision surface to look presentable.


## Usage

 Requires a Subdivision Surface Modifier to good presentable results

## Features

* Physically Based Topology
* 4k & 8K Textures

## Downsides

* Last Updated in 2022
* Textures have visible seams.
* No FACS rigging.

## Installation manual

Go to your charmorph folder, at `%APPDATA%/Blender Foundation/[INSERT YOUR BLENDER VERSION]/scripts/addons/[INSERT YOUR CHARMORPH DIRECTORY]/data/characters/` 
Extract the files to a folder called `Reom` in the `characters` folder. The end result should look something like this:
`%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.1\scripts\addons\CharMorph-master\data\characters\Reom`
Although this should be already included in future releases.
